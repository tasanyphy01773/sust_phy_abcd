# sust_phy_abcd
A simple package for Ray transfer matrix named sust_phy_abcd. The ray transfer matrix (also known as ABCD matrix) is used in the geometrical
optics for ray tracing analysis. A 2Ã—2 ray transfer matrix can estimate the behaviour
of the ray after an optical element (surface, interface, mirror, lens, graded index
surface etc.). we built a full python package of the ray transfer matrix for all
types of ABCD matrix.
